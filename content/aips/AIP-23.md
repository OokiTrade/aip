## Simple Summary

Greetings Aave community! We are the bZx team and would like to propose AAVEngers to support the listing of our token, BZRX, on AAVE's platform as a collateral asset. We believe having BZRX on AAVE would open up several exciting opportunities for both BZX and AAVE.

## Abstract

bZx is a protocol for tokenized margin trading and lending. It is a financial primitive for shorting, leverage, borrowing, lending, and yield farming that empowers decentralized, efficient, and rent-free blockchain applications.

bZx Protocol allows anyone to build applications that enable lenders, borrowers, and traders to interact with the most flexible decentralized finance protocol on Ethereum. Currently, the bZx protocol has two products: 

Fulcrum: [fulcrum.trade](https://fulcrum.trade/)
Torque: [torque.loans](https://torque.loans/)

Over the years, bZx has established a strong and loyal community that believes in the principles of DeFi and who would love to be able to use the Aave platform.

## Motivation

bZx's presence on AAVE would provide additional TVL to AAVE and an opportunity to earn additional fees as bZx holders would be able to come to AAVE to collateralize their assets.

The reason bZx's presence on AAVE will attract more users to the platform is because bZx is one of the original pioneering protocols in the Defi space. Over the years, bZx has established a strong and loyal community that believes in the principles of DeFi and who would love to be able to use the AAVE platform to collateralize their assets.

## Specification

1. What is the link between the author of the AIP and the Asset?

Tom is Co-Founder of bZx Protocol, who launched the BZRX token.

2. Provide a brief high-level overview of the project and the token

The bZx Protocol is an Ethereum based lending and margin trading platform that differentiates itself by following a three token strategy iTokens, pTokens, and BZRX tokens. While it continues to use three tokens, BZRX is its primary token, and the bZx Protocol is also designed to use the same.

3. Explain positioning of token in the AAVE ecosystem. Why would it be a good borrow or collateral asset?

The decentralized finance ecosystem has become progressively more active and experimental, culminating in various token economic incentives for activity and governance.

The new BZRX token functions as a vote in the bZxDAO, the first trias politics model of dApp governance. Complex protocols that cannot be governance-minimized require sophisticated checks and balances to ensure the protocol upgrades can proceed safely while also safeguarding critical protocol parameters. In the proposed BZRX Token Model v3, fee sharing is paired with governance to incentivize participation and align incentives.

4. Provide a brief history of the project and the different components: DAO (is it live?), products (are the live?). How did it overcome some of the challenges it faced?

Yes, the DAO is live. 

In August of 2017, Tom Bean and Kyle J Kistner conceived bZx after several months of brainstorming and exploratory efforts. 

In September, 2017, the first Github commit in the protocol contracts code repository.

In February of 2018, bZx officially releases the whitepaper after five months of concurrent coding development. bZx officially announces. “Welcome to bZx” published on Medium.

In April 201, 2018, bZx protocol debuts its fully functional smart contracts onto the Ropsten Testnet.

In January 2020, bZx protocol reached $7.5MM TVL and on June 20, 2020 the BZRX Token Model v3 was revealed.

In September 2020, bZx launched version 2.0 of Fulcrum it’s margin trading and lending platform on the Ethereum blockchain. 

In April 2021, bZx launched Fulcrum, and Torque it’s margin trading, borrowing, and lending platform on Binance Smart Chain and reached over $1b in TVL. Along with the launch, bZx introduced yield farming for 10 new BSC assets including BUSD, and BNB. Yield farming rewards were distributed in BGOV the new governance and fee token for Binance specific assets.

In June 2021 bZx merged Torque borrowing into Fulcrum to create a single app where users can margin trade, borrow, farm and lend all from one place. Additionally, bZx also added support for Polygon, the third blockchain supported by bZx with 11 supported trading pairs. Alongside launching on Polygon, bZx introduced PGOV, the governance token for Polygon specific assets. 

5. How is the asset currently used?

BZRX, being the primary token of the Protocol, is used for voting on governance decisions on the future direction of the Protocol. There is also a function–also not yet activated–to give BZRX token holders rights to the bZx insurance fund. The insurance fund comprises 10% of the interest earned by lenders–taken as part of the smart contract's design. The insurance fund protects lenders in case borrowers become unable to pay back their loans.

A number of governance proposals have been proposed and implemented to capture value and drive participation in governance. These include:

Fee sharing for participation in governance
Fee mining incentives for protocol users
Using the floating liquidity from unclaimed fees to liquidity mine BAL rewards
Asset backing the token with the insurance fund

Anyone can stake the BZRX token on the bZx website here: https://staking.bzx.network/. Staking the BZRX token entitles users to a proportional share of the platforms trading, lending, and borrowing fees.

6. Emission schedule

The total supply of BZRX is 1.030B, but much of the supply is vesting each block from the [vesting contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB72B31907C1C95F3650b64b2469e08EdACeE5e8F), and will continue to do so until July 12, 2024. Unclaimed vested tokens are held in the contract until claimed.

7. Token & protocol permissions and upgradability

Token is immutable. No admin only powers. The protocol itself can be upgraded via a governance vote of the bZxDao.

8. Market data (Market Cap, 24h Volume, Volatility, Exchanges, Maturity)

  Market Cap (circulating): $76.38mm

  Note: Market cap, ciruclating supply, and TVL numbers on Coingecko are inaccurate and very under-counted. We are working with them on a correction. TVL listed on defipulse is also very inaccurate.
